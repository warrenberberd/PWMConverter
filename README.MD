# PWMConverter

This project is for convert PWM Signal from an RC Remote controll receiver (Ex : FRSKY X8R)
wich is coded in PWM with a duty cycle of 10% (1->2ms value range over  18ms), to PWM signal
with a duty cycle range of 100% (0->100%)

The main usage is for replacing RF receiver, from a basic RC CAR, with a FRSKY module, 
to control the car with a TARANIS remote control.

With a ESP8266, gave me a 4 channels converter (4 in/4 out)
